## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes IPL matches using Power BI, focusing on key cricketing metrics such as run rates, batting partnerships, bowling economy rates, win percentage, and dismissal types. The dataset includes ball-by-ball match details and match-level summaries.
## Technologies Used
* Python(For Data Manipulation)
* MySql(For Connection)
* PowerBI(For Data Vizualization)

 ## 📂 Dataset Information
* ball_by_ball.csv - Contains ball-level data, including batters, bowlers, runs scored, and dismissals.
* Match_details.csv - Contains match-level details, including season, teams, winner, and venue.

## Power-BI Dashboard (Power BI)
We’ve created an interactive dashboard using Power BI. Here’s a screenshot: !Power BI Dashboard Analysis: We’ll discuss key insights and visualizations from the dashboard.

##  Conclusion
This IPL Power BI Analysis Project provides valuable insights into team and player performances using interactive dashboards. By leveraging DAX calculations and visualizations, we successfully analyzed key metrics such as:

* ✅ Team Performance Trends – Matches played, wins, and win percentage.
* ✅ Batting Insights – Top scorers, partnerships, and run rates per over.
* ✅ Bowling Performance – Economy rates, wickets by dismissal type, and death-over specialists.
* ✅ Match Analysis – Toss impact, run trends, and head-to-head statistics.

Through dynamic filtering (season, team, player), this project enhances decision-making and strategic planning for cricket analysts, fans, and team management. Future enhancements may include predictive analytics for performance forecasting and AI-based player impact analysis.

This project demonstrates how Power BI transforms raw data into actionable insights, making IPL analysis more engaging and data-driven. 🚀🏏
